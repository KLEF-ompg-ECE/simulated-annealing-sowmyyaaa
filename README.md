## Before You Begin — Read the Code

Open `sa_timetable.py` and read through it. Then answer these questions.

**Q1. What does `count_clashes()` measure? What value means a perfect timetable?**

```
[ YOUR ANSWER — 2 to 3 sentences ]
```

**Q2. What does `generate_neighbor()` do? How is the new timetable different from the current one?**

```
[ YOUR ANSWER — 2 to 3 sentences ]
```

**Q3. In `run_sa()`, there is this line:**
```python
if delta < 0 or random.random() < math.exp(-delta / T):
```
**What does this line decide? Why does SA sometimes accept a worse solution?**

```
[ YOUR ANSWER — 2 to 3 sentences ]
```

## Experiment 1 — Baseline Run

**Instructions:** Run the program without changing anything.
```bash
python sa_timetable.py
```

**Fill in this table:**

| Metric | Your result |
|--------|-------------|
| Number of iterations completed | |
| Clashes at iteration 1 | |
| Final best clashes | |
| Did SA reach 0 clashes? (Yes / No) | |

**Copy the printed timetable output here:**
```
[ PASTE TIMETABLE OUTPUT HERE ]
```

**Look at `plots/experiment_1.png` and describe what you see (2–3 sentences).**  
*Where does the biggest drop in clashes happen? Does the curve flatten out?*
```
[ YOUR OBSERVATION ]
```

## Experiment 2 — Effect of Cooling Rate

**Instructions:** In `sa_timetable.py`, find the `# EXPERIMENT 2` block in `__main__`.  
Copy it three times and run with `cooling_rate` = **0.80**, **0.95**, and **0.995**.  
Save plots as `experiment_2a.png`, `experiment_2b.png`, `experiment_2c.png`.

**Results table:**

| cooling_rate | Final clashes | Iterations completed | Reached 0 clashes? |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 0.80        |               |                      |                    |
| 0.95        |               |                      |                    |
| 0.995       |               |                      |                    |

**Compare the three plots. What do you notice about how fast vs slow cooling affects the result? (3–4 sentences)**  
*Hint: Fast cooling = temperature drops quickly. Does it have time to explore well?*
```
[ YOUR OBSERVATION ]
```

**Which cooling_rate gave the best result? Why do you think that is?**
```
[ YOUR ANSWER ]
```

## Summary

**Complete this table with your best result from each experiment:**

| Experiment | Key setting | Final clashes | Main finding in one sentence |
|------------|-------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| 1 — Baseline | cooling_rate = 0.995 | | |
| 2 — Cooling rate | cooling_rate = ___ | | |

**In your own words — what is the most important thing you learned about Simulated Annealing from these experiments? (3–5 sentences)**
```
[ YOUR REFLECTION ]
```
